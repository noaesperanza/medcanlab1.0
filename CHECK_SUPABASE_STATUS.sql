-- Execute este script primeiro para ver o que j√° temos

-- 1. VERIFICAR TODAS AS TABELAS EXISTENTES
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_type
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 2. CONTAR TOTAL DE TABELAS
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_tables,
    'Tabelas existentes no Supabase' as description
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- 3. VERIFICAR TABELAS PRINCIPAIS
SELECT

-- 5. VERIFICAR DADOS NAS TABELAS PRINCIPAIS
SELECT 
    'users' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records
FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'channels' as table_name,

SELECT 
    'courses' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records
FROM courses
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'clinical_assessments' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records
FROM clinical_assessments;

-- 6. VERIFICAR USU√ÅRIOS POR TIPO
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*) as total_users
FROM users
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY type;

-- 7. VERIFICAR RLS (ROW LEVEL SECURITY)
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 8. VERIFICAR √çNDICES
SELECT 
    indexname,
    tablename,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- 9. VERIFICAR FUN√á√ïES
SELECT 
    routine_name,
    routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- 10. RESUMO GERAL
SELECT 
    'STATUS ATUAL DO SUPABASE' as title,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public') as total_tables,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as total_users,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM channels) as total_channels,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages) as total_messages,
